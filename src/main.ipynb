    "**Pulsars** are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars (stellar remnants) that spin at remarkable speeds, typically hundreds of times per second. Throughout their lifetime, pulsars gradually slow down, but occasionally experience sudden bursts of increased rotation. These events, known as **glitches**, cause brief but significant jumps in the pulsar's spin rate. What makes glitches particularly interesting is their immediate onset followed by a gradual return to the previous slowdown rate, providing scientists with valuable insights into the internal workings of these dense stellar objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying physical mechanism responsible for glitches remains an active area of theoretical investigation. Two predominant hypotheses suggest that glitches arise from either: \n",
    "\n",
    "- the abrupt unpinning of superfluid vortices within the neutron star's interior\n",
    "- structural failures within the crustal region. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both proposed mechanisms result in the release of stored angular momentum, manifesting as the observed rotational acceleration of the pulsar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this investigation is to reproduce the *microphysics-agnostic meta-model* of glitch dynamics as presented by *Carlin & Melatos (2020)*. In this framework, the globally averaged internal stress in a pulsar accumulates stochastically as a **Brownian process** between glitch events, with a glitch triggered when the stress exceeds a ***critical threshold***. This approach allows us to characterize the fundamental statistical properties of glitches without relying on specific microphysical assumptions.\n"

    "A key goal of this paper is to create a framework for falsifying one or both of the Brownian and SDP meta-models by making quantitative predictions about long-term glitch statistics. As the two meta-models encompass a range of plausible microphysics, falsifying one or both has signiÔ¨Åcant scientiÔ¨Åc value in understanding which microphysical theories are consistent with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brownian meta-model exhibits notable parallels with the SDP meta-model in their fundamental structure. Both frameworks connect observable variations in $ŒΩ(t)$ to an underlying, unobservable global stress parameter that oscillates near a state of marginal stability. Furthermore, both models represent instances of self-organized critical systems, though neither explicitly incorporates a detailed microphysical trigger mechanism in their formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meta-models also differ in important respects. The driver in the SDP meta-model is secular; it does not vary with time. In the Brownian meta-model, the driving torque is a fluctuating Langevin torque with white noise statistics, as in equation (1). The SDP process never quite reaches $X = X_c$, as glitches become increasingly likely for $X \\to X_c$. In contrast, the Brownian meta-model reaches $X = X_c$ at every glitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, $\\eta(\\Delta X)$ plays a different role in the two meta-models. One has $\\Delta \\nu \\propto \\Delta X$, so $\\eta(\\Delta X)$ and $p(\\Delta \\nu)$ have the same shape in the Brownian meta-model. In the SDP meta-model, $\\eta(\\Delta X)$ is conditional on $X(t)$ just before the glitch, so $\\eta(\\Delta X)$ and $p(\\Delta \\nu)$ have the same shape only under certain conditions.\n"
